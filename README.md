# Lock-mic-vol

### Instructions

1. Download these files https://github.com/moxi-git/Lock-mic-vol/releases/download/idk/Lock.mic.vol.zip

2. Extract the files the folder to your desktop i personally recommend [Peazip](https://peazip.github.io/)

3. In the file "lock_mic_vol.bat" the default value is "58321" which is 89%, so if you want to make the volume lock onto 50% then just do some simple math ((65536/100)*50) which will give you 32768, so replace "58321" with "32768" to make the volume level lock onto 50

5. Then you can run the file "start_lock_mic_vol.bat". in the unpacked folder
